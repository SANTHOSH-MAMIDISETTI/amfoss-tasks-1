## Terminal Commands
*I used the following terminal commands*
**Ctrl+Alt+T** *to open a terminal.*
**pwd** *to print out the shellâ€™s current working directory.*
**mkdir** *to create a new directory.*
**cd** *to change the working directory.*
**touch** *to create files.*
**cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined.txt** *to combine the files.*
**mv combined.txt ../dir1** *to move the file back into the working directory.This command also lets us move more than one file at a time.*
