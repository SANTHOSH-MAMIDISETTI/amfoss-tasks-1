## Begin your journey with Linux and Git
*Learning Linux commands and using them is the most interesting part of this task.I learned the commands from reference mentioned and also Google helped me greatly.I am happy that this task made me explore more about Linux and Git.Initially i thought this would take most of my time but once i learned the TERMINAL COMMANDS, i completed it within no time.I feel this task is really engrosing.*
